# UPIICHAT

## Introduction

This project was born as a continuation of [Eduardo's](https://github.com/EduDN)
project [CHATBOT-UPIICSA](https://github.com/EduDN/CHATBOT-UPIICSA)

UPIICHAT is a simple chatbot application that aims to answer common questions
that students might have. UPIICHAT was created as a project for the UPIICSA
community of the IPN.

Technologies which this project is built on: TypeScript, Web Components,
Web Assembly, Python, Pyodide, Figma and PWA.

To make this project a reality, I had to learn a lot of new things, here is a
little roadmap of the things I learned while building this project and a little
explanation why I chose those technologies.

## Learning roadmap

This roadmap tracks my learning and development progress for UPIICHAT.

Sections will be filled with more details, resources, and insights as they are
completed.

- [ ] [Defining Project Scope & Requirements]()
<!-- - [ ] [Basic project prerequesites](#basic-project-prerequesites) -->
- [ ] [Figma Prototype](#figma-prototype)
- [ ] [PWA](#pwa)
- [ ] [Web components](#web-components)
- [ ] [Web assemby basics](#web-assembly-basics)
- [ ] [Python basics](#python-basics)
- [ ] [Pyodide basics](#pyodide-basics)

Hope you could learn one thing or two from this project as it evolves.

If you have any questions or suggestions, even about the planned sections, feel
free to open an issue.
